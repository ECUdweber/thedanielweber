# Angular 2 Starter Project

This tutorial will get you started with the soon to be released Angular2. We will cover some basic concepts, then create an extremely basic application, followed by an example that is a bit more functional.

### Basic Concepts

Angular 2 is a javascript framework that builds web applications using HTML and JavaScript. Applications are built by creating HTML templates that contain angular specific markup. Component classes are then created to manage the templates. You can also create services that retrieve and send data to and from your application.

Angular interprets our components/templates and presents your application in the browser. It also responds to users actions based on the instructions we created in our app.

#### Modules

Angular 2 applications should be modular in design.

Each module should serve a **single purpose** and we will keep adding modules as we add functionality to our application.

Modules provides or **exports** classes, functions, and values to other modules in our application.
