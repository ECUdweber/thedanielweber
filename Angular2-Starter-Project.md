# Angular 2 Starter Project

This tutorial will build an extremely simple seed project with Angular2. We will begin with the most basic application possible followed by an example that is a bit more functional.

### Overview 

Angular 2 applications are built by creating HTML templates that contain angular specific markup. Component classes are then created to manage the templates. Everything is wrapped into a module, which you piece together to create your application.

Angular interprets these modules and uses them to present your application in the browser.

### Starter Application

Let's get started with a minimal application. We will begin with an application that contains a single module. That modules only job is to display some text.
